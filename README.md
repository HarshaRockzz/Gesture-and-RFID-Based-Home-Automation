# Gesture-and-RFID-Based-Home-Automation

## Overview
This project involves creating a home automation system that uses gestures and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to control various household devices. The system aims to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing home appliances.

## Features
- Gesture recognition for device control
- RFID-based authentication and control
- Integration with various household devices
- User-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring

## Technologies
- Arduino
- RFID technology
- Gesture recognition sensors
- Python
- C/C++

## Installation
### Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board
- RFID reader and tags
- Gesture recognition sensor (e.g., APDS-9960)
- Relays for controlling household devices

### Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HarshaRockzz/Gesture-and-RFID-Based-Home-Automation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Gesture-and-RFID-Based-Home-Automation
    ```
3. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
5. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
